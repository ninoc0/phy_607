## Computational Physics
This repo stores the classwork for PHY607 - Graduate Computational Physics at Syracuse University, taught under Dr. Alex Nitz.
## Small Assignments
### 1. [Bash Scripting](https://github.com/ninoc0/phy_607/tree/main/assignment_1)
This project aimed to create a bash script that creates a backup of a folder.

### 2. [Simulating a Falling Cow](https://github.com/ninoc0/phy_607/tree/main/assignment_2)
This project aimed to simulate and graph the trajectory of a spherical cow falling with wind resistance. 

---
### 3. [Simulating Spring Oscillations](https://github.com/ninoc0/phy_607/tree/main/assignment_3)
This project used different numerical integration methods to simulate a spring's oscillations and compared their accuracy.

---
### 4. [Higher Precision Float](https://github.com/ninoc0/phy_607/tree/main/assignment_4)
This project created a method to calculate floats to a higher precision than Python natively allows. More applications can be found [here](https://github.com/chance-jackson/high_precision_floatingpt)

---
### 5. [Minimization Methods](https://github.com/SadRabbith/classminimizationmethods)
This project utilized different minimization methods to find the minimum of the Rosenbrock function. 

---
### 6. [Area and Circumference Estimations](https://github.com/SadRabbith/inclassassignment_montecarlo)
This project estimated the area and circumference of an ellipse using the Monte Carlo method.
